# 0x03. Queuing System in JS

## Description

This project involves creating a back-end queuing system using JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Redis, and Kue. The project demonstrates how to set up a Redis server, perform basic operations using a Redis client, and build a simple Express application that interacts with Redis and Kue for queuing tasks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Run a Redis server on your machine.
- Execute basic operations using the Redis client.
- Use a Redis client with Node.js for basic operations.
- Store hash values in Redis.
- Handle async operations with Redis.
- Implement Kue as a queue system.
- Build a basic Express app that interacts with a Redis server.
- Develop an Express app that interacts with both a Redis server and a queue.

## Requirements

- **Environment**: The project is compiled and interpreted on Ubuntu 18.04, Node 12.x, and Redis 5.0.7.
- **File Structure**: All files must end with a new line.
- **Filename Extensions**: Use the `.js` extension for all JavaScript files.
- **Mandatory Files**: A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory.
- **Installation**: Run `$ npm install` to install necessary dependencies from `package.json`.
